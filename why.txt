To start, your job posting is the best I've read, and I have seen quite a few. It has the most transparency all the way from a clear outline of technical skills and job responsibilities down to how the interview process is conducted. Also, I don't think I've ever seen a company reference The Joel Test before which is very refreshing. In my opinion, the Joel Test generally benefits the developers more than the bottom line profits of the company, at least, companies without a long term investment in solid, extensible and bug free software. From my experience, job postings says a great deal about how a company operates and treats its employees.

I very much enjoy the energy of a startup as it often brings new challenges to bear that need creative solutions, usually, using cutting edge technology stacks, whatever that latest and greatest may be at the time. I've enjoyed developing e-commerce sites as it tends to evolve very quickly on both the front-end and back-end.

From what I've read about Collage so far, it appears you have set a solid foundation and have been proving yourself as a successful company and I would like to be a part of that.
